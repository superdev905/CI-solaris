Likewise, in such a cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are used for range measurement or marketing purposes. A "third-party cookie" refers to cookies that are offered by providers other than the person responsible for providing the online offer (otherwise, if only their cookies are called "first-party cookies").</p><br>

In this case, pseudonymous user profiles of the processed data can be created.</p><br>
            <p>We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.</p><br>

            <p>We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online service within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO) , USA, ("Google").</p><br>
            <p>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).</p><br>
            <p>We use Google's online AdWords marketing tool "AdWords" to place ads on the Google advertising network (eg, in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) to show them to users who have a suspected interest in the ads. This allows us to better target advertisements for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. For example, if a user sees ads for products he's been looking for on other online offerings, that's called remarketing. For these purposes, when we visit our and other websites where the Google Advertising Network is active, Google will immediately execute Google code and become so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also referred to as "web beacons") incorporated into the website. With their help, the user's device stores an individual cookie, ie a small file (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). In this file is noted which web pages the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time and other information on the use of the online offer.</p><br>
            <p>Furthermore, we receive an individual "conversion cookie". The information obtained through the cookie is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us. However, we only hear about the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, we do not receive information that personally identifies users.</p><br>
            <p>The data of the users are pseudonym processed in the context of the Google advertising network. For example, Google does not store and process users' names or e-mail addresses, but processes the relevant data in a cookie-related manner within pseudonymous user profiles. That is, from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has expressly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.</p><br>
            <p>For more information about Google's data usage, hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy ( https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads ) and Google's Ads Ads Settings (https: // adssettings.google.com/authenticated ).</p>

            <p>We use the online marketing method Google "DoubleClick" to place ads on the Google advertising network (eg, in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.). Double Click is characterized by displaying real-time ads based on the alleged interests of users. This allows us to better target advertisements for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. For example, if a user sees ads for products he's been looking for on other online offerings, that's called remarketing. For these purposes, upon access to our and other websites on which the Google Advertising Network is active, Google will immediately execute a Google Code and become so-called. (Re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as "web beacons") incorporated into the website. With their help, the user's device stores an individual cookie, ie a small file (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). In this file is noted which web pages the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time and other information on the use of the online offer. a small file is saved (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can be used).

            <p>The IP address of the users is also recorded, whereby this is shortened within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and only in exceptional cases completely transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The above information may also be linked by Google with such information from other sources. If the user subsequently visits other websites, they may be shown advertisements tailored to their interests based on their alleged interests based on their user profile.</p><br>
            <p>The data of the users are pseudonym processed in the context of the Google advertising network. For example, Google does not store and process users' names or e-mail addresses, but processes the relevant data in a cookie-related manner within pseudonymous user profiles. That is, from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has expressly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users through Google Marketing Services is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.</p><br>

            <p>Based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO), we base our online offer on the conversion and tracking tool "Bing Ads" Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA. Microsoft stores cookies on the users' devices in order to enable users to analyze the use of our online offer as long as users have accessed our online offer via a Microsoft Bing ad (so-called "conversion measurement"). Microsoft and we can thus see that someone clicked on an ad, was redirected to our online offer, and reached a previously determined landing page (the so-called "conversion page"). We only learn the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were then redirected to the conversion page. No IP addresses are stored. No personal information on the identity of the users is given.</p><br>
