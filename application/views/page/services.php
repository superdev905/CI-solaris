            <p>We believe that existing online payment methods do not offer sufficient protection against fraud. Existing online payment methods usually focus on fast processing, but do not offer sufficient protection for both buyers and sellers.</p>
            <p>We combine the escrow procedure known from lawyers and notaries with digital technologies. This enables us to set new standards in payment transactions for secure trading - fair, cost-effective, fast.</p>
